Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number **12**, its reverse is **21**. Their difference is **9**. The number **120** reversed is **21**, and their difference is **99**.

She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

Given a range of numbered days, **[i...j]** and a number **k**, determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where **|i - reverse(i)|** is evenly divisible by **k**. If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Print the number of beautiful days in the range.

## Function Description

Complete the beautifulDays function in the editor below. It must return the number of beautiful days in the range.

beautifulDays has the following parameter(s):

- i: the starting day number
- j: the ending day number
- k: the divisor

## Input Format

A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective values of **i**, **j**, and **k**.


## Constraints 

- 1 <= i <= j <= 2 X 10<sup>6</sup>
- 1 <= k <= 2 X 10<sup>0</sup>

## Output Format

Print the number of beautiful days in the inclusive range between **i** and **j**.

## Sample Input

```
20 23 6
```

## Sample Output

```
2
```

## Explanation

Lily may go to the movies on days **20**, **21**, **22**, and **23**. We perform the following calculations to determine which days are beautiful:

- Day **20** is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{|20-02|}{6}&space;=&space;\frac{18}{6}&space;=&space;3)<br/>
- Day **21** is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{|21-12|}{6}&space;=&space;\frac{9}{6}&space;=&space;1.5) <br/>
- Day **22** is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{|22-22|}{6}&space;=&space;\frac{0}{6}&space;=&space;0) <br/>
- Day **23** is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number: ![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{|23-32|}{6}&space;=&space;\frac{9}{6}&space;=&space;1.5) <br/>

Only two days, **20** and **22**, in this interval are beautiful. Thus, we print **2** as our answer.

## Solution

```javascript
// Complete the beautifulDays function below.
function beautifulDays(i, j, k) {
    return new Array(j-i+1).fill(0).reduce((target, item, index) => {
        let value = i + index;
        !(Math.abs(value - +[...String(value)].reverse().join('')) % k) && target++;

        return target;
    }, 0);
}
```
