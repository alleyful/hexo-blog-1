You will be given two arrays of integers and asked to determine all integers that satisfy the following two conditions:

1. The elements of the first array are all factors of the integer being considered
2. The integer being considered is a factor of all elements of the second array

<!-- more -->

These numbers are referred to as being between the two arrays. You must determine how many such numbers exist.

For example, given the arrays **a = [2, 6]** and **b = [24, 46]**, there are two numbers between them: **6** and **12**. **6%2=0**, **6%6=0**, **24%6=0** and **36%6=0** for the first value. Similarly, **12%2=0**, **12%6=0** and **24%12=0**, **36%12=0**.

## Function Description

Complete the getTotalX function in the editor below. It should return the number of integers that are betwen the sets.

getTotalX has the following parameter(s):

- a: an array of integers
- b: an array of integers

## Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers, **n** and **m**, the number of elements in array **a** and the number of elements in array **b**. <br/>
The second line contains **n** distinct space-separated integers describing **a[i]** where **0 <= i < n**. <br/>
The third line contains **m** distinct space-separated integers describing **b[j]** where **0 <= j < m**.<br/>


## Constraints 

- 1 <= n,m <= 10
- 1 <= a[i] < 100
- 1 <= b[j] < 100

## Output Format

Print the number of integers that are considered to be between **a** and **b**.

## Sample Input

```
2 3
2 4
16 32 96
```

## Sample Output

```
3
```

## Explanation
   
2 and 4 divide evenly into 4, 8, 12 and 16. <br/>
4, 8 and 16 divide evenly into 16, 32, 96.<br/>

4, 8 and 16 are the only three numbers for which each element of a is a factor and each is a factor of all elements of b.<br/>

## Solution

```javascript
/*
 * Complete the 'getTotalX' function below.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. INTEGER_ARRAY a
 *  2. INTEGER_ARRAY b
 */

function getTotalX(a, b) {
    // Write your code here

    return new Array(100).fill(1).reduce((target, item, index) => {
        (a.every(value => !((index + 1) % value)) && b.every(value => !(value % (index + 1)))) && target++;

        return target;
    }, 0);
}
```
