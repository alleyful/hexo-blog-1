Maria plays college basketball and wants to go pro. Each season she maintains a record of her play. She tabulates the number of times she breaks her season record for most points and least points in a game. Points scored in the first game establish her record for the season, and she begins counting from there.<br/>

<!-- more -->

For example, assume her scores for the season are represented in the array **scores = [12,24,10,24]**. Scores are in the same order as the games played. She would tabulate her results as follows:<br/>

```
                                 Count
Game  Score  Minimum  Maximum   Min Max
 0      12     12       12       0   0
 1      24     12       24       0   1
 2      10     10       24       1   1
 3      24     10       24       1   1
```

Given Maria's scores for a season, find and print the number of times she breaks her records for most and least points scored during the season.

## Function Description

Complete the breakingRecords function in the editor below. It must return an integer array containing the numbers of times she broke her records. Index **0** is for breaking most points records, and index **1** is for breaking least points records.

breakingRecords has the following parameter(s):

- scores: an array of integers

## Input Format

The first line contains an integer **n**, the number of games. <br/>
The second line contains **n** space-separated integers describing the respective values of **score<sub>0</sub>, score<sub>1</sub>, ... , score<sub>n-1</sub>**.<br/>

## Constraints 

- 1 <= n <= 1000
- 1 <= scores[i] < 10<sup>8</sup>

## Output Format

Print two space-seperated integers describing the respective numbers of times her best (highest) score increased and her worst (lowest) score decreased.

## Sample Input 0

```
9
10 5 20 20 4 5 2 25 1
```

## Sample Output 0

```
2 4
```

## Explanation 0
   
The diagram below depicts the number of times Maria broke her best and worst records throughout the season:<br/>

She broke her best record twice (after games **2** and **7**) and her worst record four times (after games **1**, **4**, **6**, and **8**), so we print 2 4 as our answer. Note that she did not break her record for best score during game **3**, as her score during that game was not strictly greater than her best record at the time.

## Sample Input 1

```
10
3 4 21 36 10 28 35 5 24 42
```

## Sample Output 1

```
4 0
```

She broke her best record four times (after games **1**, **2**, **3**, and **9**) and her worst record zero times (no score during the season was lower than the one she earned during her first game), so we print 4 0 as our answer.

## Solution

```javascript
// Complete the breakingRecords function below.
function breakingRecords(scores) {
    let { countMax, countMin } = (scores || []).reduce((target, item, index) => {
        !index && (target['max'] = target['min'] = item);

        target['score'] = item;

        item > target['max'] && (target['max'] = item, target['countMax']++);
        item < target['min'] && (target['min'] = item, target['countMin']++);

        return target;
    }, { max: 0, min: 0, score: 0, countMax: 0, countMin: 0 });

    return [ countMax, countMin ];
}
```
