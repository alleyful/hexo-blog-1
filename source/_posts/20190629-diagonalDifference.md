Given a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

For example, the square matrix **arr** is shown below:

<!-- more -->

```
1 2 3
4 5 6
9 8 9 
```

The left-to-right diagonal = **1 + 5 + 9 = 15**. The right to left diagonal = **3 + 5 + 9 = 17**. Their absolute difference is **|15 - 17| = 2**.

## Function Description
            
Complete the **diagonalDifference** function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the absolute diagonal difference.

diagonalDifference takes the following parameter:

- arr: an array of integers .

## Input Format
   
The first line contains a single integer, **n**, the number of rows and columns in the matrix **arr**. 
Each of the next **n** lines describes a row, **arr[i]**, and consists of **n** space-separated integers **arr[i][j]**.

## Constraints 

**-100 <= arr[i][j] <= 100**

## Output Format
   
Print the absolute difference between the sums of the matrix's two diagonals as a single integer.

## Sample Input

```
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12
```

## Sample Output

```
15
```

## Explanation

The primary diagonal is:

```
11
   5
     -12
```

Sum across the primary diagonal: 11 + 5 - 12 = 4

The secondary diagonal is:

```
     4
   5
10
```

Sum across the secondary diagonal: 4 + 5 + 10 = 19 
Difference: |4 - 19| = 15

**Note:** |x| is the absolute value of x

## Solution

```javascript
/*
 * Complete the 'diagonalDifference' function below.
 *
 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER.
 * The function accepts 2D_INTEGER_ARRAY arr as parameter.
 */

function diagonalDifference(arr) {
    // Write your code here
    let { first, second } = (arr || []).reduce((target, item, index) => {
        target['first'] += arr[index][index];
        target['second'] += arr[index][arr.length - index - 1];

        return target;
    }, { first: 0, second: 0 });

    return Math.abs(first - second);
}
```
